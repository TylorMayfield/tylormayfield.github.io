Most people know [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin), but a little-known fact is that there are literally thousands of alternative cryptocurrencies. Another aspect that all cryptocurrencies have in common is volatility, which may seem like a deterrent to the typical investor. For day traders, however, this is a big plus; trading in Bitcoin and Altcoins allows traders to benefit from monstrous price fluctuations that are simply not seen in traditional marketplaces. 

Water is a basic need for everyone in every state, country or continent, and **H2oCoin** (Created by @Ghostbackwards & @Thisweekscoin) can help solve one of the world's biggest problems by providing access to clean drinking water for those who need it. In particular, it enables the Community to provide an alarmingly large number of people with access to clean drinking water in order to survive. 


## Background Information

Nguu Secondary School is found in Kwa Mukanda village, Nthunguni Sub-Location, Nguu Location, Nguu Division, Nzaui District of Makueni County. The school was established in 2007.

The school has a total population of 244 students (110 boys and 134 girls), 11 teachers (7 males and 4 females), 5 sub-ordinate staff (3 males and 2 females).

It is closely related with Kwa Munyaka self-help group which ASDF started to support in 2013. The self-help group (SHG) comprises of 14 members (11 males and 3 females) who are from 14 households (average household membership in the area is 6 members per household).So far the SHG has constructed 2 sand dams in their area of operation.

## Water Situation in the School

The school is situated in the semi -arid and arid lands of Makueni County which are characterized by bi-annual rains in November/December (short rains) and March/May (long rains) resulting in long dry periods throughout the year.

On average the school requires 3000 liters of water per day, which is used for cooking, drinking and washing by the students who board at the school. 90 students board at the school both boys and girls.

The current water source for the school is piped water from Mukame wa Mbeu Water Project that is not 100% reliable. The pump often breaks down thus making the school to look for alternative means of collecting water.

When the pump has a mechanical problem the school buys water from water vendors who use donkeys to fetch water from an earth dam which is 1 kilometer away from the school.

The school spends KES 20,000 (about $190) monthly in paying for the water bill that is piped in the school.

The school also does roof catchment harvesting of rain water into a 10,000 liters plastic tank.

The water in this structure lasts for 2 weeks only. The current project will add a much larger tank, allowing the school to store much more water for the dry seasons.

### Sanitation in the School

Latrines that exist in the school consist of 5 doors and a urinal for boys, 5 doors for girls and 2 doors for teachers.

Only one hand washing facility exists in the school and is used by the teachers.

### Water-Related Challenges in the School

The water related challenges outlined below are experienced in the school and especially in the driest months of the year when harvested and stored water is exhausted.

* Water is rationed for the school to maximize 3 liters per student thus straining the students affecting the performance of the students.

* The cost of buying water is high and it is included in the school fees for parents to pay.

* Cleanliness is compromised, especially washing classrooms and other hygiene practices.

# Project Results

## Rainwater Harvesting Tank

* The community and school petitioned for ASDF to come in and ascertain the water and sanitation need. When our partner arrived, they conducted meetings with the school management committee to spell out the role of the school and greater community, along with the materials that should be mobilized before construction could begin.

* Local material collection was conducted from September to November. Construction for the 190,000 liter tank began by mid-November, with a projected construction period of 21 days.

* The school management committee also mobilized parents to work as unskilled laborers on the tank. At least 15 parents showed up each construction day, supporting the ballast and cement mixing as well as other tasks. The tank was completed on December 16, 2015.

## Hand-Washing Station

* Please note that a hand-washing station was also installed for students in the latrine vicinity. When students return from holiday vacation, they will be trained on how to use and maintain their new facilities. There are reminders painted on the side of the hand-washing station that tell students the most important times to wash their hands.
