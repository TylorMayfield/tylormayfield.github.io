Exploratory Testing is essentially a software test approach that executes previously developed documentation and test cases. It is an approach to software testing that succinctly describes the nature of the test case, its implementation and the results of the tests
This test style can be a good alternative to scripted tests, which are easy for beginners to follow and look outside the box. It is a practical approach in which the tester is involved in minimum planning and maximum test execution. 

Everyone must wear a tester's hat and conduct reconnaissance tests to gather requirements before the changes are released into production. We know that exploration tests are not ad hoc tests, which implies that there are techniques and patterns to be followed. Since most testers perform many tests in the form of manual tests (e.g., manual regression tests), it is essential for ET to recognize this approach. ET, and how the team conducts the tests, as well as the testing process itself. 

So when we talk about the effectiveness of the testing process, it is important to draw attention to the project budget and deadlines. Project managers typically use this to ensure that they do not forget the necessary parts during project planning. 

There is always a need to create a mind map to show the end-to-end functionality of the application. In exploratory testing, mind mapping is a great way to take a look at the features, stories and workflows you want to test and graphically display all possible options. Exploratory Testing is about going through each level of an application and thinking about different settings as different users. By paying close attention to a particular project, you combine it with other test approaches and choose the most suitable one. Think about the possibilities of each use case and think with a different mindset, as for each user. 

This two-step process is used to perform exploratory tests while the software application is undergoing a change, for example in the form of a new version of the application or a major change to a function. 

Some people assume that this is a task where the tester simply goes through the application and sees what comes out. The goal is to explore as much as possible without encountering bugs that confuse UX, functionality or bugs. 

This is where manual exploration tests come in to provide QA management with some much-needed insights and help in developing a better understanding of the application.
